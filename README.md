MarketWatcher
=============

MarketWatcher is a simple Java app to monitor Stock quotes. It is composed of a package
that allows to monitor quotes online (for example relying on Yahoo! Finance) and a GUI
implemented using Swing. 

Note that MarketWatcher is in a very early stage of development and, at the moment being,
it is not functional at all.
